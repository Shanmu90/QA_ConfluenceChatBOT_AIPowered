Gateway timeout set to 30 seconds but average response time increased to 35 seconds during peak hours.\n\nContributing Factors\n1. Database query optimization issue in transaction lookup (N+1 problem)\n2. Insufficient connection pooling (50 connections, should be 200+)\n3. Missing circuit breaker pattern for gateway failures\n4. No request queuing mechanism\n\nEnvironment Details\nLoad: 1000+ concurrent users\nGateway API Response Time (normal): 2-5 seconds\nGateway API Response Time (peak): 35-45 seconds\nDatabase Query Time: 800ms (should be <100ms)\n\nSolution Implemented\n1. Database Optimization: Added indexes on transaction lookup queries (-87% query time)\n2. Connection Pooling: Increased to 200 connections with auto-scaling\n3. Circuit Breaker: Implemented to fail fast on gateway errors\n4. Request Queuing: Added queue with max wait time 10 seconds\n5. Timeout Extension: Extended to 60 seconds with backoff retry\n\nVerification\nLoad testing with 5000 concurrent users: ✅ Pass\n24-hour production monitoring: ✅ 0 timeout errors\nRegression testing: ✅ All 60 test cases pass\n\nPrevention Measures\nImplement automated load testing in CI/CD pipeline\nSet up proactive monitoring and alerting\nMonthly performance baseline review\nCapacity planning for peak seasons"

The system now includes automatic retry logic. If the issue persists, contact support with your transaction ID.\nRelated Test Cases: TC-005, TC-006, TC-007\n\nQ2: How long does transaction settlement take?\nA: Most transactions settle within 2-4 hours. International payments may take 24-48 hours depending on the bank.\nRelated Test Cases: TC-010, TC-011\n\nQ3: Is my payment data secure?\nA: Yes. All payment data is encrypted using TLS 1.3 and we are PCI-DSS Level 1 compliant. CVV numbers are never stored.\nRelated Test Cases: TC-012, TC-013\n\nQ4: Can I retry a failed payment?\nA: Yes. The system automatically retries failed payments up to 3 times. You can also manually retry from your transaction history.\nRelated Test Cases: TC-008, TC-009\n\nQ5: What payment methods are supported?\nA: We support: Credit Cards (Visa, MasterCard, Amex), Debit Cards, Digital Wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay), Bank Transfers (ACH)\nRelated Test Cases: TC-001, TC-002, TC-003\n\nKnown Issues\nIssue | Severity | Status | Workaround\nInternational payments incur 2.5% fee | Medium | Known | Use bank transfer for lower fees\nRefunds process in 24 hours | Low | By Design | Plan accordingly\nHigh concurrent load (>5000 users) | Critical | Resolved in v2.1.0 | Update to latest version\n\nReporting Issues\nIf you encounter any issues not listed above:\n1. Collect transaction ID and timestamp\n2. Note error message and steps to reproduce\n3. Contact: support@payment.company.com\n4. Include: Browser type, payment method, amount"
